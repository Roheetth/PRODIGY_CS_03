# PRODIGY_CS_03
The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based GUI application that helps users evaluate and improve password security. Using Tkinter, it offers a user-friendly interface for generating passwords, assessing strength, and providing feedback. 

# Password Strength Checker

This project leverages several technologies and libraries to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application for checking password strength, generating passwords, and providing feedback to users. Here are the key technologies used:

## Technologies Used

### Python
- The core programming language used to develop the entire application.

### Tkinter
- A standard GUI library in Python that provides tools for building desktop applications.
- `tk.Tk()`, `tk.Label`, `tk.Entry`, `tk.Button`, `tk.Text`, `ttk.Progressbar`, etc., are used to create and manage various GUI elements.

### Tkinter Widgets
- Widgets like `Label`, `Entry`, `Button`, `Text`, and `Progressbar` are used to create the user interface.
- These widgets allow users to interact with the application by entering passwords, clicking buttons, and viewing feedback.

### Tkinter Messagebox
- Provides a way to display message boxes for information, warnings, and confirmations (e.g., `messagebox.showinfo`, `messagebox.showwarning`, `messagebox.askokcancel`).

### Tkinter Styling
- Custom styles for the progress bar (`ttk.Style()`) to visually indicate password strength with different colors (Red, Orange, Green, Blue).

### String Module
- Used for handling and checking characters in the password (`string.ascii_lowercase`, `string.ascii_uppercase`, `string.digits`, `string.punctuation`).

### Secrets Module
- A module for generating cryptographically strong random numbers and strings, used here for password generation (`secrets.choice`).

### Pyperclip
- A cross-platform clipboard module for copying text to the clipboard (`pyperclip.copy`).

### Password Strength Check Logic
- Custom logic implemented in the `check_password_strength` function to evaluate the strength of the password based on the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, whitespaces, and special characters.
- This function also provides remarks and a strength score based on the password characteristics.

### Event Handling and Animations
- Tkinter event bindings, such as `<KeyRelease>`, to check password strength in real-time as the user types.
- Custom animation for the progress bar (`animate_progress_bar` function) to create a smooth transition effect for the strength meter.

### Application Lifecycle Management
- Handling window close events with `root.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", on_closing)` to provide a graceful exit with confirmation.

By combining these technologies, the project creates a comprehensive and interactive desktop application that helps users create and evaluate passwords effectively.
